# Raison d'Etre
## Who
Our mission is to support Penn State's third strategic priority of "Stewarding our Planet's resources" by helping researchers select the best climate data, models, and analytics for their research.

{{< figure library="true" src="about-esmad.jpg" title="" >}}

## What
We are focused developing analytic and numerical methods, sharing data, and expanding cross-domain capabilities and expertise in Earth System Modeling. The center will leverage the Penn State climate research efforts occurring across multiple academic areas by assisting in the identification and execution of classes of climate problems with medium to long-term development timeframes and high stakeholder benefit, that also:
1. Support the University's educational goals for graduate students and post-doctoral scholars,
2. Support the University's applied research initiatives, and
3. Enhance the University's service to society.

## How
To accomplish our we perform four major functions:
1. Catalog existing and develop new analytic tools to support interdisciplinary research,
2. Provide easier access to climate data,
3. Provide access to, develop new, and extend the capabilities of Earth System Models, and
4. Engage in outreach activities with faculty, departments, and colleges to provide up-to-date
information on Center capabilities and to actively seek collaborations.

# In-Depth description
This center is a critical component for maintaining and enhancing a vibrant collaborative environment across the Penn State research community as planning for climate change remains one of the grand challenges of our generation. Growth in the volume and prominence of Penn State climate research emphasizes the need for this center to share the best available research methods, data, and models to foster collaboration and build strong, long-lasting interdisciplinary collaborations across the university. The center will facilitate the bridging of basic climate and earth system research to the areas focused on finding solutions for both assessing the impacts and implementing mitigation strategies. Penn State research has a long history of strengths in all aspects of Earth system observations and modeling and this center will serve as a gathering place for experts on campus who are motivated to improve our basic understanding of the Earth system and to use the best science to solve societally relevant problems. We look forward to advancing these efforts on campus and developing the capacity to address the full range of future challenges facing our planet.

# Governance
Governance includes a Director and Assistant Director with an advisory committee. The advisory committee will include 3-5 members with representation from the communities interacting with ESMAD and, at a minimum, meet once each semester to assess the Center's progress. In the first year, the Director and Assistant Director will work with the advisory committee to generate a set of bylaws for the center based primarily on this proposal to establish the basic governance and activities of the center. The bylaws will establish the administrative oversight with representation from IEE, ICDS, and EMS and identify the role of the advisory committee.

The center will conduct a review of activities at least once every five (5) years as requested in the Research Administration Guidelines (RAG05). This review process will be outlined in the center’s bylaws and engage the advisory committee to provide the format and evaluation process. The review will assess the overall progress and provide guidance on continuing the center’s mission as presented in this proposal.
